Need to capture name.
    Match integer from name section where string exists and grab the note? Or vice versa?
Once name is captured, build struct to push new items in to and then create JSON from it. Each item is numbred 
    Maybe build a struct of names with numbers and match to the switch output.
Capture current directory name, and create new top level directory for ableton json in the same structure
